This repository explains how to build a Knock Sensor Lock using Arduino UNO.

# Introduction
This repository explains how to build a Knock Sensor Lock using an Arduino UNO. The lock system listens to the knocks on the door. If the knock matches, the servo motor unlockes the door; on the other hand, if the knock does not match, the servo motor does not turn an dkeeps the door locked. Every-time the door is unlocked, an audio recording is played to greet the user. This lock system system was installed on a cardboard house for demonstration purposes. The cardboard house has one entrance only, the main door. There are no other locks on the door other than the servo motor knock lock. The main door always remains locked and can only be unlocked by a secret knock.
