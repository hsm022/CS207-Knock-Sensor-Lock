# CS207-Knock-Sensor-Lock
This repository explains how to build a Knock Sensor Lock using Arduino UNO.

Introduction:
This project is inspired by the “Arduino Servo Motor Knock Lock tutorial” project by Tom at eTech Tom channel on YouTube. The project builds a system which detects a knock and compares it to the knock saved in the memory of the system. If the knock matches, the servo motor turns which represents a door lock being unlocked; on the other hand, if the knock does not match, the servo motor does not turn representing the door lock staying in locked position. There are also three different coloured LEDs to show locked, unlocked or listening mode and a push button to turn the servo motor to the locked position.
